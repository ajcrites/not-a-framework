# Not a Framework 0.0

Master: [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ajcrites/not-a-framework.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ajcrites/not-a-framework)

Not-a-framework is a PHP Non-framework that focuses on
code organization and flexibility.

It's goal is to provide simple organization of and
implementation for boilerplate code that will allow
developers to set up web application projects quickly.

NaF offers very few components, makes no claims for
speed, probably implements MVC incorrectly, and is
brand new.  As such it should not be used by anyone.
